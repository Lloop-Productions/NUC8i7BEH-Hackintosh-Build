# [GUIDE] Building a Mac mini beast with NUC8i7BEH
### Overview

This guide derives from @Rehabman's [[Guide] Booting the OS X installer on LAPTOPS](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-booting-the-os-x-installer-on-laptops-with-clover.148093/) and [[Guide] Intel NUC7NUC8 using Clover UEFI (NUC7i7Bxx,NUC8i7Bxx,etc)](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-intel-nuc7-nuc8-using-clover-uefi-nuc7i7bxx-nuc8i7bxx-etc.261711/) but the procedure has been simplified in order to provide a quick guide to install Mojave on the NUC8i7BEH.

#### Specs

* **HyperX Impact** DDR4 SODIMM 16GB * 1 (Recommend two sticks in dual-channel, 16GB of RAM works fine so far for me)  *Crucial DDR4 SODIMM 16GB* I bought was **not compatible** with my NUC8. For more information about the recommended RAMs by Intel, see [Memory Modules](http://compatibleproducts.intel.com/ProductDetails/ExportPeripheralInfo?moduleName=Intel%C2%AE%20NUC&productType=Kits&productName=Intel%C2%AE%20NUC%20Kit%20NUC8i7BEH) 
* **Crucial MX500** 1000G SATAIII SSD (I need the M.2 slot for Wi-FI/Bluetooth.)
* **Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Card** 
  * **BCM943602CDP** (4 antenna, IPEX1 connector) Wi-Fi/Bluetooth + [M.2 NGFF Key B+M Adapter](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/32947752122.html), *Intel antenna replacement is required.* 
  * **BCM94360CS2** (2 antenna IPEX4 connector) Wi-Fi/Bluetooth + [M.2 NGFF Key B+M Adapter](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/32947752122.html). *Intel antenna replacement is NOT required but  2.4 GHz  will have conflicts with bluetooth as they share the same connector.* 
* **M.2 NGFF Key B+M Adapter**

* **Sapphire RX 460 4G** (firmware upgraded to RX 560)
* **Mojave 10.14.2** Final Cut Pro has better performance on 10.14.2, less exporting time and better stability than the performance on 10.14.3.



#### Works

* **AirDrop, Handoff** (Apple Wi-Fi/Bluetooth required)
* **iMessage** (complete serial required) 
* **All USB3.1 Gen1/USB2.0 ports**
* **USB3.1 Type-c Hotplugging**
* **Hardware Acceleration** (Final Cut Pro X, VideoProc, Compressor tested.)
* **Thunderbolt 3 eGPU** (Final Cut Pro X, VideoProc, Compressor tested.)



#### Not working

* Thunderbolt 3 eGPU Hotplugging 



### Preparation 

#### BIOS settings

* BIOS version **0056** (<u>Please do not use the latest one, 0064</u>. If so, please downgrade to 0056, I have attached the firmware in the respository since it was no longer provided from Intel support.) 

BIOS setup can be accessed by mashing the **F2** key while booting up. It will get you to the main BIOS setup screens. To start, choose "**Load Defaults**"  (choose from the menu or press **F9** in the BIOS setup).

Then change:

- Boot -> Boot Configuration, disable "**Network Boot**"
- Power -> Secondary Power Settings, "**Wake on LAN from S4/S5**", set to "**Stay Off**"
- Boot -> Secure Boot, disable "**Secure Boot**" 
- Devices -> OnBoard Devices, disable "**Bluetooth**" (macOS is not compatible well with Intel Wi-Fi/Bluetooth)

Suggested:

- Boot -> Boot Priority -> Legacy Boot Priority, enable "**Legacy Boot**".



### Installation

#### Option 1: GUI (recommended)

* [Mojave 10.14.2 Download](https://blog.daliansky.net/macOS-Mojave-10.14.2-18C54-official-version-with-Clover-4792-original-image.html) (Clover EFI with config will be automatically installed with this ISO)
* [Install macOS with etcher](https://blog.daliansky.net/MacOS-installation-tutorial-XiaoMi-Pro-installation-process-records.html)

#### Option 2: Command-line

* Download Mojave 10.14.2 from App Store
* [[Guide] Installing macOS Mojave (10.14.2) on Intel NUCi5BEH using Clover UEFI](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-installing-macos-mojave-10-14-2-on-intel-nuci5beh-using-clover-uefi.268502/)

Note: If you get an error that says "This copy of the Install macOS Mojave.app application is damaged, and canâ€™t be used to install macOS", then open up a terminal and set the date to March 3rd, 2019 at 00:00 with `date 030300002019`

### Post-installation

#### Clover EFI 

* Download the latest EFI Clover (see [release](https://github.com/sarkrui/NUC8i7BEH-Hackintosh-Build/releases))
* Mount EFI folder with *EFI Mounter V3* or *Clover Configurator*
* Place the downloaded EFI folder in your local EFI drive

#### Fixing Continuity 

##### Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Adapter

![Untitled-1](https://i.imgur.com/YxZvkLv.jpg)

- 2-pin JST 1.00mm (pitch) connected to the adapter 
- 4-pin JST 1.25mm (pitch) connected to the NUC internal USB2.0 connector (see "G" "H")

##### Scheme 

![BT_InternalUSBHeader_Scheme](https://i.imgur.com/nqRlweB.png)

##### IPEX1 Antennas

The original antennas on NUC are using `IPEX4` connector while the `BCM943602CD`P is using `IPEX1`. Thus, I completely removed the original ones and replaced them with four IPEX1. However, it's worth mentioning that the quality of the signal drops after the replacement (for both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth).

##### Continuity Activation Tool (C.A.T)

To enable conitinuity, you must have an invaild serial number (meaning never been used by other Macs), for detailed information, please check [Generating invaild serial number from hackintosher](https://hackintosher.com/guides/quick-fixes-facetime-icloud-imessage-hackintosh-not-working/). If everything is ready and yet you still cannot have **AirDrop** and **Handoff**, please try **C.A.T** to activate continuity. 

#### FRC Reverse Proxy

Frp is a fast reverse proxy to help you expose a local server behind a NAT or firewall to the internet. As of now, it supports TCP & UDP, as well as http and https protocols, where requests can be forwarded to internal services by domain name. For example, with Frp, **VNC** port (5900), **SSH** port (22), and **FTP** port (445) on Macs behind a NAT, can be exposed to the public. Therefore, a user can have access to **Screen Sharing**, **File Sharing** remotely.
